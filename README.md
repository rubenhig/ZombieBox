ZombieBox is an endless 2D top-down shooter with online multiplayer support, built from scratch with Godot Engine and C#.

The goal is to survive endless waves of enemies in a cooperative (or competitive) environment. This project emphasizes a clean, scalable architecture to facilitate future development and expansions.
